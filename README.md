# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge
## Introduction:
Welcome to the "Escape Vanilla JS Challenge"! This web page presents three rooms, each with its own JavaScript challenge. To solve each room, simply click on the corresponding button.

## Room 1: The JSON Library
In this room, the challenge is to find the most recent book from a JSON library. Clicking the "Find the Most Recent Book" button will fetch data from a JSON file containing information about books. The most recent book's title will be displayed as the result.

## Room 2: The Set Chamber
In this room, the challenge is to find common concepts between JavaScript and React. Two sets of concepts are defined, one for JavaScript and one for React. Clicking the "Find Common Concepts" button will identify and display the common concepts between the two sets.

## Room 3: The Asynchronous Labyrinth
In this room, the challenge is to navigate through a labyrinth asynchronously. Clicking the "Navigate the Labyrinth" button will fetch data from data from aJSON file containing directions. The directions will be displayed one by one with a delay of 1 second each, simulating navigation through the labyrinth. Once navigation is complete, a congratulatory message will be displayed.

## Reflections
The "Escape VanillaJS Challenge" was an interesting exercise in JavaScript programming. It provided pactice in using Fetch API to fetch data from data from JSON files, manipulating arrays and sets, and working with asynchronous functions.

Room 1 challenge was to find the most recent book from a JSON library by comparing publication dates. Room 2 required finding common concepts between two sets, which was achieved using set operations. Room 3 introduced asynchronous programming by navigating through a labyrinth with delayed steps.

## My Thoughts:
* The concept of structuring JavaScript tasks as escape rooms is pretty inventive, in my opinion. It makes learning more exciting and memorable by bringing a sense of adventure and excitement to it.
* I like how the challenges are set up so that they get harder as we move through the rooms and this strengthens my grasp of JavaScript fundamentals.

Overall, this challenge helped better my understanding of core JavaScript concepts and provided valuable experience in solving practical problems using JavaScript.
