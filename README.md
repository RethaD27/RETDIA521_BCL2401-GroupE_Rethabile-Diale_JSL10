# [JSL10] Submission: Escaping Vanilla JS: Abstraction Challenge

Welcome to the "Escape Vanilla JS Challenge"! This web page presents three rooms, each with its own JavaScript challenge. To solve each room, simply click on the corresponding button.

## Room 1: The JSON Library
In this room, the challenge is to find the most recent book from a JSON library. Clicking the "Find the Most Recent Book" button will fetch data from a JSON file containing information about books. The most recent book's title will be displayed as the result.

## Room 2: The Set Chamber
In this room, the challenge is to find common concepts between JavaScript and React. Two sets of concepts are defined, one for JavaScript and one for React. Clicking the "Find Common Concepts" button will identify and display the common concepts between the two sets.

## Room 3: The Asynchronous Labyrinth

The directions will be displayed one by one with a delay of 1 second each, simulating navigation through the labyrinth. Once navigation is complete, a congratulatory message will be displayed.
